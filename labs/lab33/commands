Use a Blue-Green-Deployment to switch quickly between two versions with at least 3 replicas and at most 5 replicas

Delete the existing deployments of the php app.

$ kubectl delete deployment php-app


Update the Service to only select Pods from stage "blue".

kind: Service
spec:
  selector:
    run: demo
    stage: blue


Create a new version of the PHP image, make sure the version is visible from the output (f.e. “blue”)

$ export BLUE_IMAGE_NAME=$(uuidgen)
$ docker build -t ttl.sh/${BLUE_IMAGE_NAME}:24h .
$ docker push ttl.sh/${BLUE_IMAGE_NAME}:24h


Update the Deployment to include an additional label to discriminate the blue/green stage and reference the new image (or substitute it later).

kind: Deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: demo
      stage: blue
  template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          run: demo
          stage: blue

Apply the Deployment.

$ cat blue-deployment.yaml | envsubst '${BLUE_IMAGE_NAME}' | kubectl apply -f -

Access the service to validat everything works.

Create a new version of the PHP image, make sure the version is visible from the output (f.e. "green")

$ export GREEN_IMAGE_NAME=$(uuidgen)
$ docker build -t ttl.sh/${GREEN_IMAGE_NAME}:24h .
$ docker push ttl.sh/${GREEN_IMAGE_NAME}:24h

Create a second Deployment including the green stage label and referencing the new green image (or substitute it later).

kind: Deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: demo
      stage: green
  template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          run: demo
          stage: green

$ cat green-deployment.yaml | envsubst '${GREEN_IMAGE_NAME}' | kubectl apply -f -

Switch from blue to green by updating the Service label-selector.

$ kubectl patch service php-app -p '{"spec": {"selector": {"run": "demo", "stage": "green"}}}'

Switch back.
You can access the service from a second terminal while switching.

$ while true; do curl -s https://php-app-student01.t9v.de | grep Welcome; done;
$ kubectl patch service php-app -p '{"spec": {"selector": {"run": "demo", "stage": "blue"}}}'

Delete the unused deployment.
