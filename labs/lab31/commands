Update the php-app to contain new output (f.e. “v2”)

Build a new image (avoid ":latest" as usual for consistency and traceability).

$ export IMAGE_NAME=$(uuidgen)
$ docker build -t ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME}:24h .
$ docker push ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME}:24h

Update the deployment with the new image or substitute the placeholder with the new image name.

$ cat deployment.yaml | envsubst '${IMAGE_NAME}' | kubectl apply -f -

Observe the rollout and access the app during the rollout

$ kubectl get pods -w

Access the application during the update with a browser or curl.
Note that you will see output from old and new version in unpredictable order.

Force a rollout without changes.

$ kubectl rollout restart deployment php-app
