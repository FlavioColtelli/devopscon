A short reminder how to provide an image: (lab22)

$ export IMAGE_NAME=$(uuidgen)
$ docker build -t ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME}:24h .
$ docker push ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME}:24h

Switch to the right Namespace in case you changed it in between.

$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=workshop

Use your ReplicaSet for the PHP application from lab25 as base for the Deployment to be created in this lab.

Change the kind to Deployment.
Make sure to adjust the image name in the YAML or substitute the placeholder when applying.

$ cat deployment.yaml | envsubst '${IMAGE_NAME}' | kubectl apply -f -

Get the status of all relevant components. (Ingress and Service are from lab23)

$ kubectl get all,ingresses
